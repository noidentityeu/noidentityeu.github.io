**User Agent** is a short identifier containing information about your *browser* and its version, *operating system* and its version and other details.

While it feels generally useless, there is catch: if you use some non-usual browser version and older operating system, **you might be tracked by web server owners*.

## Possible solution

The most reasonable solution is to use the latest operating system and the latest browser version. This way, it would be hard to trace you.

### Changing User-Agent

It is also possible to change User-Agent, however, many sites change appearance based on this string and thus changing it to particularly wrong one is a bad idea.
