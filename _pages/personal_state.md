State usually records a lot. While personal data is not usually available, there are some bits of data which are meant to be public.


## Commercial registers

In most countries, as of our knowledge, the address of the company is public. Many people register companies with the address at their home. Thus, it is often possible to learn the address of a person by looking up person's companies or person relatives' companies.
