How to store personal data in the Internet?

## Avoid that as much as possible

Your name is no longer personal. You can leave it in the Internet, but consider the website.

Don't record your place of living. Usually, you can trust the banking and state institutions, so it is more or less safe to write it there.

Better don't post your phone publicly. Otherwise, you might get too many spam calls. Additionally, your address of living might be detected.

## Passwords

Your password must be random and mustn't repeat. More symbols, better.

Use application like KeePass to store your password. Usually, there are agents on the phone and on the laptop that allow entering passwords kept there with ease.

Consider risks of cloud password storages. They effectively carry the most important data. Please think whether the password storage website it credible.
