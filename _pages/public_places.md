Ok, you decided to use public WiFi access point. What can go wrong?

## Non-encrypted traffic might be hijacked

Number one rule: **don't use HTTP sites**. It is obvious, but it is not comprehensive. The reason is that, in case of third-party applications, it is impossible to be sure that your traffic is always encrypted.

Therefore, let's proceed to practical advices.

## Make sure that WiFi access point is password-protected

Naturally, open WiFi is not protected against sniffing since the traffic is not encrypted. Literally any WiFi device in *monitor mode* might capture all the traffic.

## WiFi access point must be trusted

Use access points only from more or less trusted providers, world-wide networks etc.
It is not 100% guarantee of security, therefore, if you are paranoid about security, proceed to the next point.

## Use VPN

In public places, **only [Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)](/vpn.html) are reasonable solutions**. Once you establish VPN connection, all the traffic is encrypted regardless of the fact if WiFi traffic is or not, whether you trust it or not.
