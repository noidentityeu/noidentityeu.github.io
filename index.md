Welcome to No Identity. We would like to teach you principles of hiding off the radars.

In this project, we aim at informing people rather than confusing them with too much information. Thus, we prefer simplicity over completeness.


## Overview

To get rid of websites tracking you, first of all, you have to make sure your IP address is not trackable or rather *can not be associated* to you.

 - [IP addresses (theory)](/ip.html)

That might employ the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN):

 - [VPN (TODO)](/vpn.html)

Second, even if you use VPN, it is possible (but unlikely) that your Domain Name resolution subsystem (DNS) is not configured properly and is leaking the websites you visit to the original DNS server of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Even if not, beware of DNS.

 - [DNS (TODO)](/dns.html)

Third, perform trivial checks before you start using VPN for needed purpose to ensure that VPN configuration is correct.

 - [Pre-flight checks (TODO)](/preflight.html)

It is possible for website owners to associate your device with you by looking up your User-Agent field set by the web browser. Sometimes, it might be pretty unique. Beware of that and take actions.

 - [User Agents (TODO)](/user_agents.html)

Be sure to use websites using HTTPS only. Always check that certificates are valid - these red flags or scaring warning in your browser are important and might indicate Man-in-the-middle attack.

 - [HTTPS (TODO)](/https.html)

WiFi-routers are used a lot nowadays, so they are normal targets for hackers. What can you do to ensure they are not hacked?

 - [WiFi Routers (TODO)](/routers.html)

If you use WiFi in public places, ensure that you follow best practices to avoid being traced and sniffed.

 - [Public places (TODO)](/public.html)
